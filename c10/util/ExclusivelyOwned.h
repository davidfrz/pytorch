// TODO: document ExclusivelyOwnedTraits and settle on names (and

// TensorBody.h and intrusive_ptr.h.
// REVIEW: would anyone like to argue that it doesn't make sense to
// have this traits class, and instead we should just have two
// explicit specializations of ExclusivelyOwned? There would be some
// small amount of code duplication, but perhaps it would be easier to
// understand?

/// ExclusivelyOwned is a smart-pointer-like wrapper around an
/// exclusively-owned instance of some type T that normally has
/// mandatory reference counting (currently Tensor or
/// c10::intrusive_ptr). If you have an isolated piece of code that
/// knows that it has sole ownership of an object of one of these
/// types (i.e., because you created it directly or using a factory
/// function) and that object will not escape from that isolated piece
/// of code, then moving the object into an ExclusivelyOwned will
/// avoid an atomic reference count decrement at destruction time.
///
/// If you directly create the Tensor/intrusive_ptr in the first
/// place, you can use the in_place constructor of ExclusivelyOwned to
/// additionally avoid doing any stores to initialize the refcount &
/// weakcount. (Do note, however, that in this case you should
/// probably just use std::unique_ptr instead of intrusive_ptr if applicable.)
